# The Practice

Natarajah Yoga is a holistic approach to yoga. The practice is centered around the four pillars: Karma (action), Bhakti (love/devotion)i, Jnana (knowledge) and Raja (meditation) yoga. We perform the Natarajah Yoga practices to expand our awareness and touch the mystical state. Over time we become established in our experience of yoga or oneness with God. The Natarajah Yoga practices include meditation techniques, asana, chanting, service, retreats and more.

Satyān nāsti paro dharma

सत्यान्नास्ति परो धर्मः

**There is no Religion Higher than Truth**

_"The body is a vehicle, the mind like a steering system, the soul a driver. Yoga allows us to refine our transportation system to maximize our souls experience and connect with our indwelling source of Divinity."_

~S.S.S. Yogiji 

Every aspect of the practice gives access to another taste of our essential nature. Strength and mobility comes from asana, contentment and heighten awareness arise from meditation, detachment and love from selfless service and generosity is cultivated through dakshina. Continuous study and contemplation of the teachings provides the understanding of our experiences and inspires us to go deeper. Every person finds there own unique combination of practices that works best by cultivating and listening to their own inner wisdom.

Many people find the practice of Natarajah Yoga within a group setting enhances the sense of community and accelerates their personal practices.

Through right effort in the practices (sadhana), supported by grace and good company (sangat), we continually step closer to living a truly spiritual life.
