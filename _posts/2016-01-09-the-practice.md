description: 'Natarajah Yoga is a holistic approach to yoga. The practice is centered around the four pillars: Karma (action), Bhakti (love/devotion)i, Jnana (knowledge) and Raja (meditation) yoga. We perform the Natarajah Yoga practices to expand our awareness and touch the mystical state. Over time we become established in our experience of yoga or oneness with God.'

## Natarajah Yoga | The Practice

Natarajah Yoga is a holistic approach to yoga. The practice is centered around the four pillars: Karma (action), Bhakti (love/devotion)i, Jnana (knowledge) and Raja (meditation) yoga. We perform the Natarajah Yoga practices to expand our awareness and touch the mystical state. Over time we become established in our experience of yoga or oneness with God.
