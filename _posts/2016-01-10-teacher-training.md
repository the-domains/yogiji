## Teacher Training 

NATARAJAH YOGA is a holistic approach to yoga, which has its roots in the ancient Kundalini and Tantric traditions. The Natarajah Yoga teacher training combines the subtle internal work of Kundalini with the technical precision of Iyengar and Ashtanga. The training is a comprehensive and explores healing and transformation on the personal level. We want to cultivate your natural radiance and instill practices that will have you excel as a teacher with integrity and excellence. Yoga is an experience, transformation happens through the personal  experiences born from developing a personal Sadhana to help you mature and refine a clear authentic sense of self.
